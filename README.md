# Personal-website
This is a personal webpage of [Marijn Haverbeke](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/), the author of "Eloquent JavaScript". 

I have recreated this site to look as closely to the original with my personal details of course.  
The webpage will be flexible and prone to changes and will be updated to fit my taste and preferences as i learn more of programming.

It was built using HTML & CSS
